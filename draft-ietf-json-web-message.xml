      <section anchor="relationship-to-jwt" title="Relationship to JWT">

        <t>JWMs conceptually share many parallels to JWTs, these similarities can be summarized in the following way.</t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>A JWM contains a JSON based payload comprised of attributes known as a JWM Attribute Set, where public attributes are defined in an IANA registry, this is conceptually 
              parallel to claims, the JWT Claim Set and the JWT claims IANA registry.</t>
              <t>A JWM leverages JSON Web Message (JWS) and or JSON Web Encryption (JWE) to achieve digital signing, integrity protection and or confidentiality via encryption for the JWM attribute set when required.</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>JWMs also deviate in important ways from JWTs which prevents using the JWT specification directly to achieve the functionality provided by a JWM.</t>
            <t>
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>JWTs due to the requirement of them being compact in nature and URL safe, require the usage of compact serialization for both JWS and JWE representations. 
                This compact serialization requirement for JWE limits JWTs to only being able to encrypt a payload to one recipient. Whereas JWMs  
                do not require the use of compact serialization of JWE, instead they permit the JSON based serialization of JWE, which allows for a JWM to be prepared for multiple 
                recipients.</t>
                <t>The intent of a JWM is different to a JWT. A JWM is about a sender creating a message composed of attributes that are destined for a recipient or 
                recipients. Whereas a JWT is about an issuer expressing claims about a subject to an audience. This conceptual difference means a meaningful separation 
                of the terminology is required to limit confusion for specification implementers.</t>

      <t>The JWM Attributes Set represents a JSON object whose members are the attributes conveyed by the JWM. The Attribute Names

      <t>The set of attributes that a JWM must contain to be considered valid is context dependent and is outside the scope of this specification.

        <t>The "typ" (type) Header Parameter defined by <xref target="RFC7515"/> and <xref target="RFC7516"/> is used
        by JWM applications to declare the media type <xref target="IANA.MediaTypes"/> of
        this complete JWM.  This is intended for use by the JWM application
        when values that are not JWMs could also be present in an application
        data structure that can contain a JWM object; the application can use
        this value to disambiguate among the different kinds of objects that
        might be present.  It will typically not be used by applications when
        it is already known that the object is a JWM.  This parameter is
        ignored by JWM implementations; any processing of this parameter is
        performed by the JWM application.  If present, it is RECOMMENDED that
        its value be "JWM" to indicate that this object is a JWM.  While
        media type names are not case sensitive, it is RECOMMENDED that "JWM"
        always be spelled using uppercase characters for compatibility with
        legacy implementations.  Use of this Header Parameter is OPTIONAL.</t>

        the JWM.</t>

        <t>In the normal case in which nested signing or encryption operations
        are not employed, the use of this Header Parameter is NOT
        RECOMMENDED.  In the case that nested signing or encryption is
        employed, this Header Parameter MUST be present; in this case, the
        value MUST be "JWM", to indicate that a Nested JWM is carried in this
        JWM.  While media type names are not case sensitive, it is
        RECOMMENDED that "JWM" always be spelled using uppercase characters
        for compatibility with legacy implementations.</t>

      <section anchor="replicating-attributes-as-header-parameters" title="Replicating Attributes as Header Parameters">
        <t>As is also the case with JWTs, in some applications using encrypted JWMs,
        it is useful to have an unencrypted representation of some attributes. 
        This might be used, for instance, in application processing rules to 
        determine whether and how to process the JWM before it is decrypted.</t>

        <t>This specification allows Attributes present in the JWM Attributes Set to be
        replicated as JOSE Header Parameters in a JWM that is a JWE, as needed by
        the application.  If such replicated attributes are present, the
        application receiving them SHOULD verify that their values are
        identical, unless the application defines other specific processing
        rules for these attributes.  It is the responsibility of the application
        to ensure that only attributes that are safe to be transmitted in an
        unencrypted manner are replicated as JOSE Header Parameter values in the

      MAY also be created without a signature or encryption.  An Unsecured

          <t>Determine whether the JWM is a JWS or a JWE using any of the
          methods described in Section 9 of <xref target="RFC7516"/>.</t>
          <t>Depending upon whether the JWM is a JWS or JWE, there are two
          cases:
            <list style="symbols">
            <t>If the JWM is a JWS, follow the steps specified in <xref target="RFC7515"/> for
            validating a JWS.  Let the Message be the result of base64url
            decoding the JWS Payload.</t>
            <t>Else, if the JWM is a JWE, follow the steps specified in
             <xref target="RFC7516"/> for validating a JWE.  Let the Message be the resulting
            plaintext.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>If the JOSE Header contains a "cty" (content type) value of
          "JWM", then the Message is a JWM that was the subject of nested
          signing or encryption operations.  In this case, return to Step
          1, using the Message as the JWM.</t>
          <t>Otherwise, base64url decode the Message following the
          restriction that no line breaks, whitespace, or other additional
          characters have been used.</t>
          <t>Verify that the resulting octet sequence is a UTF-8-encoded

        </list></t>

        <t>Finally, note that it is an application decision which algorithms may
        be used in a given context.  Even if a JWM can be successfully
        validated, unless the algorithms used in the JWM are acceptable to
        the application, it SHOULD reject the JWM.</t>

      <t>This section defines which algorithms and features of this
      specification are mandatory to implement.  Applications using this
      specification can impose additional requirements upon implementations
      that they use.</t>

      <t>Supported for digitally signed JWMs using JWS is REQUIRED. Of the signature and 
      MAC algorithms specified in JSON Web Algorithms <xref target="RFC7518"/>, only 
      ECDSA using the P-256 curve and SHA-256 hash algorithm ("ES256") and "none" MUST be 
      implemented by conforming JWM implementations. It is RECOMMENDED that implementations
      also support ECDSA using the P-521 curve and the SHA-512 hash algorithm ("ES512") and 
      EdDSA using the Ed25519 curve and SHA-512 hash algorithm. Support for other 
      algorithms and key sizes is OPTIONAL.</t>

      <t>Support for encrypted JWMs using JWE is also REQUIRED. Of the encryption algorithms
      specified in <xref target="RFC7518"/>, using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral 
      Static (ECDH-ES) to agree upon a key and using this key to to perform key wrapping
      of a Content Encryption Key ("ECDH-ES+A128KW" and "ECDH-ES+A256KW") MUST be supported. 
      With regards to content encryption, AES in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) with 128-bit and 256-bit
      keys ("A128GCM" and "A256GCM") MUST also be supported.</t>

      <t>Support for Nested JWMs is also REQUIRED.</t>

    <section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>All of the security issues that are pertinent to any cryptographic
      application must be addressed by JWM/JWS/JWE/JWK agents.  Among these
      issues are protecting the user's asymmetric private and symmetric
      secret keys and employing countermeasures to various attacks.</t>

      <t>All the security considerations in the JWS specification also apply
      to JWM, as do the JWE security considerations when encryption is
      employed.  In particular, Sections 10.12 ("JSON Security
      Considerations") and 10.13 ("Unicode Comparison Security
      Considerations") of <xref target="RFC7515"/> apply equally to the JWM Attributes Set in the
      same manner that they do to the JOSE Header.</t>

      <section anchor="trust-decisions" title="Trust Decisions">
        <t>The contents of a JWM cannot be relied upon in a trust decision
        unless its contents have been cryptographically secured and bound to
        the context necessary for the trust decision.  In particular, the
        key(s) used to sign and/or encrypt the JWM will typically need to
        verifiably be under the control of the party identified by the associated
        cryptographic operation.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="signing-and-encryption-order" title="Signing and Encryption Order">
        <t>While syntactically the signing and encryption operations for Nested
        JWMs may be applied in any order, if both signing and encryption are
        necessary, normally producers should sign the message and then
        encrypt the result (thus encrypting the signature).  This prevents
        attacks in which the signature is stripped, leaving just an encrypted
        message, as well as providing privacy for the signer.  Furthermore,
        signatures over encrypted text are not considered valid in many
        jurisdictions.</t>

        <t>Note that potential concerns about security issues related to the
        order of signing and encryption operations are already addressed by
        the underlying JWS and JWE specifications; in particular, because JWE
        only supports the use of authenticated encryption algorithms,
        cryptographic concerns about the potential need to sign after
        encryption that apply in many contexts do not apply to this
        specification.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="privacy-considerations" title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>A JWM may contain privacy-sensitive information.  When this is the
      case, measures MUST be taken to prevent disclosure of this
      information to unintended parties.  One way to achieve this is to use
      an encrypted JWM and authenticate the recipient.  Another way is to
      ensure that JWMs containing unencrypted privacy-sensitive information
      are only transmitted using protocols utilizing encryption that
      support endpoint authentication, such as Transport Layer Security
      (TLS).  Omitting privacy-sensitive information from a JWM is the
      simplest way of minimizing privacy issues.</t>
